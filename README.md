# NoteTakerExpress

## description 

This project was designed to keep track of user information and having the ability to write, store, and delete notes the user wishes to take through a server. In this project we were provided with the entire front end code to display the html and its functions. For the developing end, we were tasked with coding a server.js and API routing to connect the front end sites. 

## Tools 
The tools we used were Node.js/Express, as well as OOP (Object oriented programming).

## challenges

some of the challenges I came across during this development was having proper routing with the files and making sure the pathing to each html file was precise. Failure to do so resulted in a lot of errors and inablity to connect to the server (local host 3001) when I was able to connect to the front end I found out that it was quite difficult to get the proper functions of saving to work. Unsure of what the problem was, I had thought it was the front end site development for not having the proper button saved. Still unsure of the issue 

## Site connetion and functionality
